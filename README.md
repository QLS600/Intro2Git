# Intro to Git/GitHub
This repository is to help us get familiar with working with git and GH. 

For starters, try creating a new branch (with your name) and edit this ```README``` by adding a piece of life advice you wish you knew sooner, something that's on your bucket list, or anything else creative! Push your changes back to ```master``` branch so it will be updated for the next person to make their changes.

Feel free to explore the different tabs, open up issues, assign tasks to other members (can be as innocuous as "close this issue"), or nothing at all.

## Organization layout
Within the QLS600 organization, there is a new 'Team' for our cohort (with the idea that this organization can be used by other QLS cohorts when they get to this module). It is possible to create team-of-teams, therefore, throughout the module, we can create sub-teams when working on group assignment.
